# Joy-Con Hardware Mod

This project documents a small hardware modification I performed on a pair of Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers. The goal was partly for fun and partly cosmetic, and the work involved opening the controllers, swapping components, and navigating the extremely compact internal layout.

## Overview
Joy-Con internals are tightly packed, with delicate ribbon cables, tiny screws, and very little room to maneuver. This project required patience and careful handling to avoid damaging the connectors or internal components.

## Tools Used
- Plastic pry tool/spudger  
- Precision Phillips screwdriver  
- Y‑tip (tri‑wing) screwdriver  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Handling compact consumer electronics  
- Managing fragile ribbon cables  
- Disassembly and reassembly of tight internal hardware  
- Basic troubleshooting when connectors don’t seat correctly  

## Notes
The most challenging part of the process was reseating the small ribbon cables. They require precise alignment and don’t always latch cleanly on the first attempt.

## Disclaimer
Opening Joy-Con controllers voids the warranty. This project is for personal experimentation and documentation only.
